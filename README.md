# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

###Basic Features to Implement
User Authentication: Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their sessions.
File Upload and Download: Enable users to upload files to the cloud and download them as needed.
File Preview: Provide a way for users to preview their files directly in the app.
File Organization: Implement folders and subfolders for users to organize their files.
Search Functionality: Allow users to search for files and folders by name.
Sharing Files: Enable users to share files with others, either via a link or by inviting users directly.
Responsive Design: Ensure the app works well on both desktop and mobile devices.


React: The core library for building your user interface. Its component-based architecture will help you create reusable and maintainable code.

Redux or Context API: For state management, especially if your application grows in complexity. These tools will help you manage the state of your application efficiently.

React Router: To handle navigation and routing within your application. It will allow you to create a multi-page experience within a single-page app.

Firebase: A great backend-as-a-service option for authentication, real-time database, and storage. Firebaseâ€™s ease of integration with React makes it a popular choice for many developers.

Material-UI: For a modern and responsive user interface. Material-UI provides a set of React components that implement Google's Material Design.
